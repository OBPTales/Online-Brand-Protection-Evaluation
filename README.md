# Why an Open Source RFP guide?

I initiated this project to assist organizations in comparing Online Brand Protection (OBP) vendors. 

After receiving requests from several organizations for help in evaluating OBP vendors, I decided to open source the project. In fact, in the inherently fragmented landscape of the internet, safeguarding brands requires collaborative efforts to tackle common challenges that are too significant for individual organizations to overcome alone. By emphasizing transparency and cooperation, the benefits of open source include increased innovation, shared knowledge, and community-driven enhancements. These principles have inspired the creation of this RFP guide, which draws on the experiences of several practitioners and seeks constructive feedback from the brand protection (BP) community.

In this guide, you will find a solid foundation for your RFP plan to compare and evaluate different OBP providers. The document allows for customization and adaptation to meet your organization's specific needs. It also outlines reasonable conditions for potential vendors to fulfill regarding their expertise and technical capabilities in online brand protection. While the BP community behind this project cannot provide any assurances, a vendor that meets the outlined conditions is likely to be a strong technical partner for your project.

### If you are preparing a Request for Proposals, this material will help you:

- Identify OBP service providers that possess technical expertise and have experience in online intellectual property enforcement. 
- Conduct an objective comparison of competing vendors. 
- Implement a transparent and standardized process that considers all significant factors for evaluating and comparing multiple vendors.
